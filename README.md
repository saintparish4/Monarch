# Monarch

> **The missing infrastructure for consumer dApps on L2s**

Building consumer dApps on L2s shouldn't feel like building DeFi. Monarch provides the missing infrastructure for social media, creator platforms, gaming, and e-commerce applications.

## Why Monarch?

### The Problem
Current smart contract libraries are DeFi-focused, leaving consumer app developers to reinvent the wheel for basic patterns like:
- Gasless transactions
- Social features  
- Progressive onboarding
- User-friendly interactions

### The Solution
Monarch offers **production-ready contracts** specifically designed for consumer use cases, optimized for L2 networks like Base.

## Features

- **Consumer-Focused**: Built specifically for social, gaming, and e-commerce dApps
- **L2 Optimized**: Designed for Base and other Layer 2 networks
- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested smart contracts
- **Gasless Transactions**: Built-in support for meta-transactions
- **Social Features**: Native social interaction patterns
- **Progressive Onboarding**: Smooth user experience from Web2 to Web3

## Architecture

Monarch is built with a modular architecture that allows developers to:

- **Mix and match** components based on their needs
- **Extend** functionality through the module system
- **Customize** behavior while maintaining security

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test
```
